## Overview

### Introduction

Welcome to the `README.md` of this repo! The purpose of creating this project is to sharpen my coding skill.

In this file I'm going to tell you everything, starting from tools that I used, and much more.

That's it for the introduction and **happy reading!**

### The Challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- See visible focus states for interactive elements when navigating by keyboard
- Understand and be able to navigate page content while using assistive technology
